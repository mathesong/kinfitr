\title{Tstar Finder: MRTM1}
\usage{
mrtm1_tstar(
  t_tac,
  reftac,
  lowroi,
  medroi,
  highroi,
  filename = NULL,
  frameStartEnd = NULL,
  gridbreaks = 2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{t_tac}{Numeric vector of times for each frame in minutes. We use the
time halfway through the frame as well as a zero. If a time zero frame is
not included, it will be added.}

\item{reftac}{Numeric vector of radioactivity concentrations in the reference
tissue for each frame.}

\item{lowroi}{Numeric vector of radioactivity concentrations in a target
tissue for each frame. This should be from a ROI with low binding.}

\item{medroi}{Numeric vector of radioactivity concentrations in a target
tissue for each frame. This should be from a ROI with medium binding.}

\item{highroi}{Numeric vector of radioactivity concentrations in a target
tissue for each frame. This should be from a ROI with high binding.}

\item{filename}{The name of the output image: filename_mrtm1.jpeg}

\item{frameStartEnd}{Optional: This allows one to specify the beginning and
final frame to use for modelling, e.g. c(1,20). This is to assess time
stability.}

\item{gridbreaks}{Optional. The size of the grid in the plots. Default: 2.}
}
\value{
Saves a jpeg of the plots as filename_mrtm1.jpeg
}
\description{
Function to identify where t* is for MRTM1. Remember that this is unnecessary
if the kinetics in the target tissue can be described by a one tissue
compartment model (like SRTM).
