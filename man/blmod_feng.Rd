\arguments{
\item{time}{The time of each measurement in seconds}

\item{activity}{The radioactivity of each measurement}

\item{Method}{Optional. The method of collection, i.e. "Discrete" or
"Continuous"}

\item{weights}{Optional. Weights of each measurement.}

\item{fit_t0}{Should time point zero be fitted? If not, it is set to 0.
Default is TRUE.}

\item{lower}{Optional. The lower limits of the fit. If left as NULL, they
will be given reasonable defaults (mostly 10\% of the starting parameters).}

\item{upper}{Optional. The upper limits of the fit. If left as NULL, they
will be given reasonable defaults (mostly 150\% of the starting
parameters).}

\item{start}{Optional. The starting parameters for the fit. If left as NULL,
they will be selected using \code{blmod_exp_startpars}.}

\item{multstart_lower}{Optional. The lower limits of the starting parameters.}

\item{multstart_upper}{Optional. The upper limits of the starting parameters.}

\item{multstart_iter}{The number of fits to perform with different starting
parameters. If set to 1, then the starting parameters will be used for a
single fit.}

\item{Method_weights}{If no weights provided, should the weights be divided
by discrete and continuous samples equally (i.e. with more continuous
samples, the continuous samples each get less weight). Default is TRUE.}

\item{taper_weights}{If no weights provided, should the weights be tapered to
gradually trade off between the continuous and discrete samples after the
peak?}

\item{weightscheme}{If no weights provided, which weighting scheme should be
used before accommodating Method_divide and taper_weights? 1 represents a
uniform weighting before accommodating Method_divide and taper_weights. 2
represents time/AIF as used by Columbia PET Centre. Default is 2.}

\item{check_startpars}{Optional. Return only the starting parameters. Useful
for debugging fits which do not work.}

\item{expdecay_props}{What proportions of the decay should be used for
choosing starting parameters for the exponential decay. Defaults to 0 and
0.5, i.e. the latter two exponentials, B, C, beta, gamma are estimated
using halfway to the end of the decay, and the beginning to halfway through
the decay. The first parameters, A and alpha, are estimated from the
ascent.}

\value{
A model fit including all of the individual parameters, fit details,
  and model fit object of class blood_feng.

\description{
Fit a Feng model to AIF data. This model fits the conventional Feng model to
AIF data. Note: this model is pretty terrible for just about all tracers
except for FDG. The convolved Feng model, fengconv is usually much more
effective.
