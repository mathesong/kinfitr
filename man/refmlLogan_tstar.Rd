\title{Tstar Finder: Non-Invasive Multilinear Logan Plot}
\usage{
refmlLogan_tstar(t_tac, reftac, lowroi, medroi, highroi, k2prime, filename,
  gridbreaks = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{t_tac}{Numeric vector of times for each frame in minutes. We use the time halfway through the frame as well as a
zero. If a time zero frame is not included, it will be added.}

\item{reftac}{Numeric vector of radioactivity concentrations in the reference tissue for each frame.}

\item{lowroi}{Numeric vector of radioactivity concentrations in a target tissue for each frame. This should be from a ROI with low binding.}

\item{medroi}{Numeric vector of radioactivity concentrations in a target tissue for each frame. This should be from a ROI with medium binding.}

\item{highroi}{Numeric vector of radioactivity concentrations in a target tissue for each frame. This should be from a ROI with high binding.}

\item{k2prime}{Value of k2prime to be used for the fitting, i.e. the average tissue-to-plasma clearance rate. This can be
obtained from another model, or set at a specified value. If using SRTM to estimate this value, it is equal to k2 / R1.}

\item{filename}{The name of the output image: filename_refmlLogan.jpeg}

\item{gridbreaks}{Optional. The size of the grid in the plots. Default: 2.}

\value{
Saves a jpeg of the plots as filename_refmlLogan.jpeg
