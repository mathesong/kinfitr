\title{Transform weights for Patlak plot}
\usage{
weights_Patlak_transform(t_tac, tac, input, weights_original)
}
\arguments{
\item{t_tac}{Numeric vector of times for each frame in minutes.}

\item{tac}{Numeric vector of radioactivity concentrations in the target
tissue for each frame.}

\item{input}{Data frame containing the blood, plasma, and parent fraction
concentrations over time. This can be generated using the
\code{blood_interp} function. The AIF column will be interpolated to
match t_tac times.}

\item{weights_original}{Numeric vector of the original weights assigned to
each frame.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of transformed weights suitable for Patlak plot
  regression. NA values indicate frames that cannot be weighted (e.g.,
  zero AIF values).
}
\description{
Transforms original TAC weights to weights appropriate for Patlak plot
regression using the delta method. The Patlak Y-axis is TAC/AIF.
}
\details{
This function uses the delta method to propagate variance from the
  original TAC measurements to the transformed Y values (TAC/AIF). The
  arterial input function is treated as noise-free.
