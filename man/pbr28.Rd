\title{PBR28 Test-Retest Data}
\format{
A nested data frame with 24 rows and 10 variables:
\describe{
  \item{PET}{Descriptor of the PET measurement}
  \item{Subjname}{Descriptor of which individual was measured}
  \item{PETNo}{Descriptor of the PET number}
  \item{tacs}{Nested tibble of the TAC data. Consists of Times, in seconds; Weights, between 0 and 1; StartTime, in seconds; Duration, in seconds, and TACs for Frontal Cortex (FC), Temporal Cortex (TC), Striatum (STR), Thalamus (THA), Whole Brain (WB), and Cerebellum (CBL)}
  \item{procblood}{Nested tibble of the processed blood data which was generated for Matheson et al. (2017). Preprocessing was performed using in-house methods. This data does not contain information about automatic and manual sampling. Consists of Time in seconds (Time), blood radioactivity following dispersion correction (Cbl_dispcorr) and plasma radioactivity following metabolite correction (Cpl_metabcorr)}
  \item{Genotype}{Refers to the High Affinity Binder (HAB) or Mixed Affinity Binder (MAB) genotype}
  \item{injRad}{Injected radioactivity}
  \item{jsondata}{This information is the contents of the BIDS json sidecar for each PET measurement. This contains all the raw blood data.}
