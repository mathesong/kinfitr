\title{Perform Dispersion Correction on a blooddata object}
\usage{
bd_blood_dispcor(
  blooddata,
  timedelta = NULL,
  keep_interpolated = T,
  smooth_iterations = 0,
  tau = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{blooddata}{A blooddata object created using one of the
create_blooddata_* functions.}

\item{timedelta}{The time difference between each measured sample. Defaults
to the most common time difference between the first 20 measurements.}

\item{keep_interpolated}{Defaults to TRUE: should interpolated samples which
were not included in the original input be included in the output.}

\item{smooth_iterations}{The number of times that the smoothing of each pair
of observations should be performed using blood_smooth. Defaults to 0.}

\item{tau}{The dispersion constant in unit seconds. If NULL (default),
this value will be extracted from the constant in the blooddata object.
This parameter is included as a manual override.}
}
\value{
A blooddata object after dispersion correction.
}
\description{
Dispersion corrected is performed on the continuous blood data if it has not
already been performed.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
blooddata <- bd_blood_dispcor(blooddata)
}
