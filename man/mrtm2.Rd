\usage{
mrtm2(
  t_tac,
  reftac,
  roitac,
  k2prime,
  tstarIncludedFrames = NULL,
  weights = NULL,
  dur = NULL,
  frameStartEnd = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{t_tac}{Numeric vector of times for each frame in minutes. We use the time halfway through the frame as well as a
zero. If a time zero frame is not included, it will be added.}

\item{reftac}{Numeric vector of radioactivity concentrations in the reference tissue for each frame. We include zero at
time zero: if not included, it is added.}

\item{roitac}{Numeric vector of radioactivity concentrations in the target tissue for each frame. We include zero at time
zero: if not included, it is added.}

\item{k2prime}{Value of k2prime to be used for the fitting, i.e. the average tissue-to-plasma clearance rate. This can be
obtained from MRTM1 of SRTM, or set at a specified value. If using SRTM to estimate this value, it is equal to k2 / R1.}

\item{tstarIncludedFrames}{Optional. The number of frames to be used in the multiple regression. This is a count from the end of the
measurement, so a value of 10 means that last 10 frames will be used. This value can be estimated using \code{mrtm2_tstar}. Note
that this tstar differs from that of the non-invasive Logan plot (which is the point at which pseudo-equilibrium is reached).
Rather, with MRTM1 and MRTM2, all frames can be used provided that the kinetics in the target tissue can be described by a one
tissue compartment model (like SRTM).  If this is not the case, a t* is required.}

\item{weights}{Optional. Numeric vector of the weights assigned to each frame in the fitting. We include zero at time zero:
if not included, it is added. If not specified, uniform weights will be used.}

\item{dur}{Optional. Numeric vector of the time durations of the frames. If
not included, the integrals will be calculated using trapezoidal integration.}

\item{frameStartEnd}{Optional: This allows one to specify the beginning and final frame to use for modelling, e.g. c(1,20).
This is to assess time stability.}
}
\value{
A list with a data frame of the fitted parameters \code{out$par}, the model fit object \code{out$fit}, a dataframe
containing the TACs of the data \code{out$tacs}, a dataframe containing the TACs of the fitted values \code{out$fitvals},
a vector of the weights \code{out$weights}, the specified k2prime value \code{out$k2prime}, and the specified
tstarIncludedFrames value \code{out$tstarIncludedFrames}.
}
\description{
Function to fit MRTM2 of Ichise et al. (2003) to data.  This model is often used alongside MRTM1: MRTM1 is run on a
high-binding region to obtain an estimate of k2prime, and this k2prime value is used for MRTM2.
