\title{Transform weights for reference Patlak plot}
\usage{
weights_refPatlak_transform(t_tac, reftac, roitac, weights_original)
}
\arguments{
\item{t_tac}{Numeric vector of times for each frame in minutes.}

\item{reftac}{Numeric vector of radioactivity concentrations in the reference
tissue for each frame.}

\item{roitac}{Numeric vector of radioactivity concentrations in the target
tissue for each frame.}

\item{weights_original}{Numeric vector of the original weights assigned to
each frame.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of transformed weights suitable for reference Patlak
  plot regression. NA values indicate frames that cannot be weighted (e.g.,
  zero reference TAC values).
}
\description{
Transforms original TAC weights to weights appropriate for reference Patlak
plot regression using the delta method. The refPatlak Y-axis is ROI/REF.
}
\details{
This function uses the delta method to propagate variance from the
  original TAC measurements to the transformed Y values (ROI/REF). The
  reference TAC is treated as noise-free.
